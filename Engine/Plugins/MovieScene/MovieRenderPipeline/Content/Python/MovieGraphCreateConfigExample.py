# This example is designed to show you how to create a Movie Graph Configuration asset,
# and add several settings nodes, configure settings on them, and then wire the nodes
# together into a graph. This is finally saved as a package in the Content Browser,
# so you can pick it in the Movie Render Queue UI (after converting a job to use the graph)
# 
# USAGE:
#   - Requires the "Python Editor Script Plugin" to be enabled in your project.
#
#   Open the Python interactive console and use:
#       import MovieGraphCreateConfigExample
#       MovieGraphCreateConfigExample.CreateBasicConfig()
#       OR
#       MovieGraphCreateConfigExample.CreateIntermediateConfig()
#       OR
#       MovieGraphCreateConfigExample.CreateAdvancedConfig()
#
# NOTES:
#
#    - Currently the "Select" nodes are not exposed to the Python API due to their complexity.
#      They internally use dynamic data types which makes it difficult to expose to Python.
