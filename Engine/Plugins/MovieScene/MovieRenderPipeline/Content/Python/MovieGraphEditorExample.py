# USAGE:
#   - Requires the "Python Editor Script Plugin" to be enabled in your project.
#   In the main() function, you'll find examples demonstrating how to load and 
#   modify movie graphs, overwrite exposed variables and perform other 
#   operations related to the Movie Render Graph
#
#   Make sure to change the "Assets to load" section to point to your own 
#   Movie Render Queue and Movie Graph Config Assets
